# Block syncing of specific file types

You can prevent users from syncing specific file types when they sync their OneDrive for Business files. This will not prevent upload actions in the browser.
  
 **To block syncing of specific file types**
  
1. Open the [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com/?v=SyncSettings), and click **Sync** in the left pane.

2. Select the **Block syncing of specific file types** check box. 
    
3. Click **Edit**.
    
4. Type the file name extensions you want to block, for example: **exe** or **mp3**. 
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Do not include the periods with the extensions, or any other punctuation, spaces, or special characters. 
  
5. Click **Save** on the Sync page.
